# Flight Price Analysis Web Application

## Overview

This project is a Flask-based web application that provides real-time flight price data analysis. The application fetches data from the AviationStack API and displays it on a user-friendly interface with options to search, filter, and paginate the data.The idea was supposed to make a web-site which can help people with flights price details and provide them with visual representation of various data.Even though the implemented product seems different with paid API-key we can get the price details of flights and make the project as intended to.Thanks

## Features

- Real-time flight price data retrieval.
- Search functionality for flight numbers, flight status, departure and arrival airports.

### Future probable features

- With paid API key or scrapping data directly through websites price data can be taken.
